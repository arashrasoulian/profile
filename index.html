        <p>
          I excelled in math through school, winning competitions. This led me
          to study mathematics at university. While a student at university, I
          began teaching violin, I have been playing the violin since I was 7
          years old. However, after 18 years of teaching, conducting youth
          orchestras, and running a podcast, I realized my true passion is
          programming. And now I have been looking for my passion for a year.
